2. If multiple entities match the query, introduce them first and then list them clearly.
3. If only one entity matches, explain why it is the result.
4. Do not invent information that is not in the context.
5. If the question asks for coordinates, extract them from the text and show them clearly.
6. If no entities match the query, respond exactly with:
   "No entities match the given conditions, try asking other ques :("

Context:
